# Django-based open-source scheduling app

This project aims to be an open-source alternative to sites like Doodle, where
you can schedule a meeting according to the time options of multiple people. 

The app is written in Django, it tries to be as modular as possible and uses as
much of the Django generic views structure as possible. 

I am no HTML/CSS wizard, so forgive the looks.
